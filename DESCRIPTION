Description: This package provides calculators to estimate the group-level 
    distribution of SF-6D profiles, mean SF-6D utility values, and corresponding
    uncertainty intervals from group-level summary statistics (mean and standard
    deviation) of SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component
    Summary (MCS) scores in osteoarthritis patients. For details, refer to 'An
    algorithm to predict mean SF-6D utility values from mean SF-12 MCS and PCS
    scores in osteoarthritis patients' [manuscript under review].
